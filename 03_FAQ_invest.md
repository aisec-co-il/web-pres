# **AI::Sec - Enterprise Sales FAQ**

## **1. What is AI::Sec and what problem does it solve?**  
AI::Sec is an **AI-powered Application Security (AppSec) automation solution** designed for enterprises, MSSPs, and regulated industries. It **automates 90% of AppSec tasks**, including vulnerability management, compliance enforcement, and secure development, reducing security costs while improving efficiency.  

ðŸ”¹ **Problem:** Growing security demands, talent shortage (4M+ unfilled cybersecurity jobs), and high costs of manual security reviews.  
ðŸ”¹ **Solution:** AI::Sec **replaces manual security processes with AI-driven automation**, reducing reliance on human AppSec engineers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Outcome:** Faster product releases, lower operational costs, and stronger security.  

ðŸ’¡ *"Think of AI::Sec as your **automated AppSec engineer**, working 24/7 to secure your applications at scale."*

## **2. How does AI::Sec validate market demand?**  
âœ… **Growing demand for automated security solutions:** Enterprises **spend over $520B annually** on cybersecurity salaries, proving the market need for automation.  
âœ… **Competitive edge:** Unlike traditional tools (Snyk, Veracode, Checkmarx), AI::Sec **automates the full AppSec workflow**, not just vulnerability scanning.  
âœ… **Proven business model:** Companies are willing to pay for **AI-powered security engineers via subscription**, as AI::Sec costs **$80Kâ€“$120K per year**, compared to **$150Kâ€“$250K per human engineer**.  

ðŸ’¡ *"AI::Sec enables enterprises to scale security without increasing headcount."*

## **3. How does AI::Sec outperform ASOC, Snyk, and other automated AppSec tools?**  
### **1. AI::Sec Goes Beyond Traditional ASOC & SCA Solutions**  
ðŸ”¹ **Traditional AppSec tools (Snyk, Veracode, Checkmarx, ASOC solutions)** focus **only on specific parts** of the security lifecycle (e.g., static/dynamic analysis, dependency scanning).  
ðŸ”¹ AI::Sec **automates the entire AppSec workflow**, from **secure code review, compliance enforcement, vulnerability management, and DevSecOps automation**â€”not just detection but **actual remediation** and **risk-based prioritization.**  

ðŸ’¡ *Think of AI::Sec as replacing manual AppSec engineers, not just enhancing existing tools.*  

### **2. AI::Sec Eliminates AI Hallucinations with Deterministic Security Automation**  
ðŸ”¹ **Existing LLM-based tools (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL, etc.) are unreliable in security-critical environments** because they generate **hallucinated responses** and lack validation mechanisms.  
ðŸ”¹ AI::Sec uses a **finite automata (FA) and directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based architecture** to ensure predictable, structured, and **deterministic** security automation.  
ðŸ”¹ This means **zero false positives**, **zero AI hallucinations**, and **fully auditable security actions.**  

ðŸ’¡ *Most security AI solutions are statistical. AI::Sec is deterministicâ€”ensuring security decisions are always valid and repeatable.*  

### **3. AI::Sec Runs AI Inference Efficiently On-Prem Without High Costs**  
ðŸ”¹ Most commercial AI models (GPT-based security tools) are **cloud-only** due to licensing restrictions and high computational costs for on-prem AI inference.  
ðŸ”¹ AI::Sec provides a **commercially licensed LLM** optimized for **on-prem deployment**, reducing **GPU and RAM requirements by 70% compared to traditional AI models**.  
ðŸ”¹ This allows **regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense, critical infrastructure)** to **use AI-powered AppSec without compliance risks** from cloud-based AI.  

ðŸ’¡ *Most AI-driven security solutions are not optimized for on-prem. AI::Sec delivers enterprise-ready AI with cost-efficient local deployment.*  

### **4. AI::Sec Provides a Fully Automated Security Engineer â€“ Not Just a Scanning Tool**  
ðŸ”¹ **Snyk, Veracode, and Checkmarx** help identify vulnerabilities, but **humans still have to review, triage, and fix them**.  
ðŸ”¹ AI::Sec **automates not just detection, but also remediation recommendations, compliance enforcement, and risk-based prioritization**â€”making it a true **replacement for an AppSec engineer**, not just a tool for them.  
ðŸ”¹ **Seamless ASOC Integration** â€“ Works directly with **Application Security Orchestration & Correlation (ASOC) platforms (ArmorCode, ZeroNorth)** to automate security workflows, enforce compliance, and optimize DevSecOps security testing.

ðŸ’¡ *Traditional AppSec tools require human intervention. AI::Sec replaces manual processes entirely.*
